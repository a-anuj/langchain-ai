# LangChain Projects: Memory, Agents, and Chains

This repository contains a collection of practical implementations using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) to explore **Memory**, **Agents**, and **Chains**â€”the building blocks of context-aware, dynamic, and multi-step applications powered by LLMs.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

### ðŸ§  Memory
- Utilize LangChain memory modules to enable conversational context retention.
- Examples include:
  - `ConversationBufferMemory`
  - `ConversationSummaryMemory`
  - `ConversationTokenBufferMemory`
  - `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`

### ðŸ¤– Agents
- Leverage LangChain's agent architecture to dynamically choose tools at runtime.
- Implements:
  - `ZeroShotAgent`

### ðŸ”— Chains
- Build sequential workflows and modular pipelines using LangChainâ€™s chaining interface.
- Includes:
  - `LLMChain`
  - `SequentialChain`
