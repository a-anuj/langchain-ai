At its heart, democracy is simple: power in the hands of the people. It means every voice matters, every vote counts, and no one is above the law. It's not just about elections, it's about freedom, fairness, and participation—the right to speak, question, and choose.

But democracy isn’t perfect. It needs constant care. If people don’t vote, don’t speak up, or let corruption grow, democracy weakens. As citizens, it's our job to keep it alive by staying informed, raising our voice, and standing up for what’s right.

Let’s not forget—freedom wasn’t given, it was earned. So let’s protect it, cherish it, and strengthen it—for us and the future.
